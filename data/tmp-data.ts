Born Idek Trzmiel in Lodz, Poland, in 1928, his \\n childhood was shattered when Nazi forces invaded Poland. From age 12 to 16, he endured \\n the unimaginable horrors of Auschwitz concentration camp, an experience that forged an \\n unbreakable determination and fierce survival instinct that would define his entire approach \\n to business. After liberation and immigration to New York in 1947, Tramiel served in the U.S. Army, \\n where he learned electronics repair—skills that would prove instrumental in his \\n future. In 1954, he founded Commodore International in Toronto as a humble typewriter \\n repair business, but his vision extended far beyond simple repairs. The trauma of his youth \\n had instilled in him a relentless drive to succeed and an unwavering belief that through sheer \\n determination and strategic thinking, any obstacle could be overcome.

I don't believe in \\n compromising,\" and this combative approach led him to make bold decisions that others \\n considered reckless. When he acquired MOS Technology in 1976, bringing Chuck Peddle and \\n the 6502 processor in-house, Tramiel gained control over the critical components needed \\n to build affordable computers. His management style was notoriously demanding but \\n effective—he walked factory floors daily, knew every manufacturing process intimately, and \\n expected nothing less than excellence from his teams. Tramiel understood that controlling \\n every aspect of production, from semiconductor fabrication to final assembly, was \\nessential to achieving the cost reductions necessary to make computers truly affordable for \\n ordinary families.",
