          "text": "Jack Tramiel was born Idek Trzmiel on December 13, 1928, in Łódź, Poland, into a world that would soon be torn apart by war. As a Jewish child during World War II, he endured the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust, surviving Auschwitz concentration camp from age 12 to 16. This formative experience forged an unbreakable will and a fierce determination that would define his entire life. After the war, he immigrated to New York City in 1947, where he served in the U.S. Army and learned electronics repair—skills that would prove instrumental in his future endeavors. In 1954, he founded Commodore International in Toronto, starting as a humble typewriter repair business. Through sheer determination and an innate understanding of market dynamics, Tramiel transformed this small operation into a calculator manufacturing company, then ultimately into one of the most influential computer companies in history. \\n Tramiel's business philosophy was elegantly summarized in his famous motto: \"We need to build computers for the masses, not the classes.\" This democratizing vision drove every major decision at Commodore, from aggressive pricing strategies to innovative manufacturing approaches. He believed in vertical integration, controlling every aspect of production from semiconductor fabrication to final assembly, which allowed Commodore to maintain quality while achieving unprecedented cost reductions. His management style was notoriously demanding but effective—he walked factory floors daily, knew every process intimately, and expected nothing less than excellence from his teams. Tramiel viewed business as warfare, famously stating \"Business is war. I don't believe in compromising,\" and this combative approach led to legendary price wars that destroyed competitors and opened computing to millions of families who could never have afforded an Apple II or IBM PC.",

His decision to price it at $595—half the cost of comparable machines—revolutionized the home computer market and made programming accessible to an entire generation. Though he was forced out of Commodore in 1984 during a boardroom coup, Tramiel's vision had already changed the world. He continued his impact by purchasing Atari Corporation, where he oversaw the development of the ST line of computers. Beyond the impressive sales figures and market dominance, Tramiel's true legacy lies in the democratization of computing power—his relentless focus on affordability and accessibility helped transform computers from expensive business tools into household staples, fundamentally altering how humanity interacts with technology and laying the groundwork for the digital age that followed.",
